## Description
Our idea is to develop an app that will notify the users of the app nearby (within 100-200 meters), the location of the accident and as soon as the notification update is clicked the location of the app users will be sent to nearby hospital and police (only after getting confirmed by the other app users who are also in the same 100-200mtr range). So, the collective confirmation of 5-10 users will result in an approximate area of accident which will be sent directly to nearby police station and Hospitals.
To confirm that no group of people is trying to fake the accident the app will be linked to ADHAAR NUMBER not with E-mail id.

## Problems we aim to solve
In India whenever there is an accident on highway there is a Hectic procedure to go through which sometimes leads to death of the patient. Firstly, the NH officials confirms the accident then the hospital and police are informed. This leads to a great delay in taking the patient to the Hospital.
